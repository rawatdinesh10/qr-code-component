## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
-I have used h1, p, and div elements to structure the page. I have used flexbox to display elements in flex.


### What I learned

I have learned the basics of HTML tags such as h1, p, and img tags. I have also learned about CSS flexbox to layout the elements on page. 





### Continued development

I am comfortable with basic HTML but i need to improve on CSS. I need to learn the intermediate and advcance CSS in order to improve myself. i need to focus on layout and responsive web design and practice it.
